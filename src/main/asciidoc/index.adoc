= Getting Started With Spring REST Docs

This is an example output for a service running at http://localhost:8080:

Meals - GET
^^^^^^^^^^^
.request
include::{snippets}/meals/get/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/meals/get/http-response.adoc[]

Meals - POST
^^^^^^^^^^^^
.request
include::{snippets}/meals/create/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/meals/create/http-response.adoc[]

As you can see the format is very simple, and in fact you always get the same message.
